### Porescale flow solver using lattice Boltzmann method

#### Introduction

This solver implements the idea in "A high-performance lattice Boltzmann implementation to model flow in porous media, Computer Physics Communications 158 (2004) 89â€“105".

It uses a sparse lattice representation for the pores part of the porous matrix.
Combined with the Orthogonal recursive bisection domain decomposition,
it can achieve a super linear parallel efficiency.

Currently, only single phase LB model has been implemented.


#### Compiling and run
To compile

```bash
make
```

To run

1. preprocess : `./preprocess 40` where 40 is the number of MPI process
2. solver     : `mpirun -np 40 -machinefile ~/hosts` ./porelb.x 100000` where 100000 is the total LB steps
3. postprocess: `./postprocess A 1000 2000 3000` Save the full flow data at time step 1000 2000 and 3000.
or `./postprocess X 200 1000 2000 3000` to slide out the slice X=200
